When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Especially when working from different computer remote repository would be greatly useful.
  And then the changes can be easily translated back to the local repository.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Pulling chnages manually enables the programmers to sync both the local and reomte repository 
  only when thwy would want. Its gives more flexibilty to the users.
